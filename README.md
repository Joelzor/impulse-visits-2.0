## Impulse Visits 2.0

I'm currently working on the second version of Impulse Visits, a project I started building at the end of the front-end module during my bootcamp at Boolean. This is a simple Tripadvisor-like website that allows users to search for cities and find tourist attractions in the area.

This new version features a log in system and is fully responsive. The code is also much cleaner than before- the first version was my first ever project (outside of tutorials), and was a bit of a mess. With this second attempt, I've tried to split things up in a nicer way while also using some new skills.
